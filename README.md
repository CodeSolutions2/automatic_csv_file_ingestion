# Automatic_csv_file_ingestion
Automatic csv file ingestion: sorting of files by header, upload to cloud

[0] sort_common_header.sh (Available for purchase on Upwork: )

A function that will organize a folder of csv files into three folders: exact_match_header, similar_match_header, no_match_header. The exact_match_header files all have the same common header, so they can be uploaded directly to a cloud server.
